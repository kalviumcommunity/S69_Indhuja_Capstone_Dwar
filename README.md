# Capstone Project Overview: Empowering Change â€“ Bridging Donors with Causes

---

## Project Idea Brief

Connecting Donors with Causes is a web platform that connects donors with non-profit organizations (NGOs). The platform simplifies charitable giving by providing a transparent and organized system for donors to discover causes, contribute, and track their donations. NGOs can list causes, set funding goals, and track donations in real-time.
The platform offers donors the ability to choose causes based on their interests and occasions (e.g., healthcare, education, environment, birthday, memorial), urgency, and funding goals, while also tracking their donation history. This system will help improve the overall donation process, making it more personalized and accessible.



## Problem Being Solved

- **Lack of Transparency:** Many NGO websites are not user-friendly, lacking easy access to search, filter, and discover causes.
- **Limited Access:** Donors currently don't have a centralized platform to find causes matching their interests, nor do they have options for recurring donations or tracking impact.
- **No Real-Time Tracking:** Donors are often unable to track the impact of their contributions, which can reduce engagement.



## Solution Provided

- **Centralized Platform:** A unified space for donors to discover, contribute, and track causes based on personal preferences.
- **Advanced Search Filters:** Donors can filter causes by category, funding goals, urgency, etc.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Donors can track the progress of the causes they support and measure the impact of their donations.
- **NGO Management Features:** NGOs can manage their causes, set goals, and update donation progress efficiently.



## Key Features to be Implemented in the First 4 Weeks

- **User Authentication & Profile Management:** Donors can create accounts, log in, and track donation history.
- **NGO Listings & Cause Management:** NGOs can list causes, set funding goals, and track donations.
- **Search Functionality:** Donors can search for causes by category, funding goal, and urgency.
- **Responsive Design:** The platform will be mobile-first, ensuring it works across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **File Upload Functionality:** NGOs can upload images or documents to support their causes.
- **Third-Party Authentication (Google):** Users can log in with Google for easier access.
- **JWT-Based Authentication:** Secure, stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens.

## Project Plan: 4-Week Timeline

### Week 1: Project Setup, Design, and Backend Development
- *Low-Fidelity Design (Wireframes):* Define core pages and user flow (homepage, search results, user profile, cause listing, and cause details).
- *High-Fidelity Design (UI Mockups):* Create detailed UI mockups for key features like search filters, donation forms, and cause details.
- *GitHub Repository Setup:* Initialize the repository for project management, version control, and collaboration.

### Week 2: Backend Completion and Database Setup
- *Backend API Setup:* Develop GET, POST, and PUT API routes for retrieving and updating data (e.g., causes, donations).
- *Deploy Backend Server:* Host the backend server using platforms like Heroku or AWS.
- *Database Schema Creation:* Design and implement the database schema to store user profiles, causes, and donations (MongoDB or SQL).
- *CRUD Operations:* Implement create, read, update, and delete operations for causes and donations.

### Week 3: Frontend Setup, React Components, and Authentication
- *React Frontend Initialization:* Set up a React app using tools like Create React App.
- *Deploy Frontend Server:* Deploy the frontend to a platform like Netlify or Vercel.
- *Create React Components:* Develop components such as the homepage, profile page, cause cards, and donation forms.
- *File Upload and Authentication:* Implement file upload functionality for NGOs and basic username/password authentication for users.

### Week 4: Third-Party Authentication, Final Refinements, and Testing
- *Google Login Integration:* Implement Google OAuth to allow users to log in with Google for convenience.
- *Enable CRUD Operations in React:* Allow users to update and delete causes and donations through the frontend.
- *JWT Authentication:* Ensure all routes are protected using JWT for secure user sessions.
- *Testing and Refinements:* Conduct UI and backend testing to ensure all features work as expected and fix any UI/UX issues.



## Future Enhancements (Post-Week 4)

- **Advanced Search Filters:** Enhance search functionality with location-based filters and more advanced options.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate payment gateways like Stripe to allow direct donations through the platform.
- **Crowdfunding Campaigns:** Enable NGOs to create fundraising campaigns with specific goals and deadlines.
- **In-Person Appointment Booking:** Allow donors to book in-person visits with NGOs for a more personal connection.



## Milestone Summary

- **Week 1:** Project setup, design, and backend API development.
- **Week 2:** Backend API deployment, database schema creation, and CRUD operations.
- **Week 3:** React frontend setup, component creation, and authentication implementation.
- **Week 4:** Google login integration, CRUD operations, JWT authentication, and testing.
